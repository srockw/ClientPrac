# ClientPrac

- Most of the code here was based on a [Freecam Mod for 1.8.9](https://github.com/Duckulus/Freecam-1.8.9) made by Duckulus, thus why some of the mixins are credited to them

Mod that allows to create a client-sided entity to practice parkour around you.

To use this mod setup a keybind in the MC control settings and press it to toggle practice.
You can change some settings by going to your mod list ingame and clicking on the ClientPrac mod options.

(This works. But I do not know how safe it is to use in servers, from my experience it is safe to use in Hypixel Housing)
